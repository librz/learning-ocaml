This repo is my notes while learning OCaml, a FP(functional programming) language.

### Resources for learning OCaml (they are all FREE of charge):

- Text Book [OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html)
- Video Course [康奈尔】OCaml函数式编程](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1dv4y127Ui/)
- Yet Another Text Book: [Real world Ocaml](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/index.html)
- Official Site [ocaml.org](https://ocaml.org)
